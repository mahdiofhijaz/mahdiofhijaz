### Hello there 👾

I’m a computational scientist specialized in molecular simulations and protein engineering, applying modeling techniques across diverse disciplines and systems.

* I'm currently working on allostery (long range communication) in proteins
* Interested in collaborating on method development relating to protein motion and function?  Let’s connect
* When I'm not simulating proteins, you can find me at the peak of a mountain in Switzerland 🏔

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-hijazi/)
