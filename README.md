### Hello there 👾

I’m a computational scientist with expertise in molecular simulations and protein engineering , applying computational modeling across a range of disciplines and systems.

* I'm currently working on allostery (long range communication) in proteins
* If you are interested in collaborating on method development relating to protein motion and function, feel free to reach out!
* When I'm not simulating proteins, you can find me at the peak of a mountain in Switzerland 🏔

Alternatively, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-hijazi/)
