### Hello there 👾

I am a computational scientist with experience in molecular simulations and protein engineering and a passion for computational modeling no matter the system.

- I'm currently working on allostery (long range communication) in proteins
- Looking to collaborate on method development to relate protein motion and function
- When I'm not simulating proteins, you can find me at the top of a mountain in Switzerland 🏔
